    computeslip(mom, δ, force)

Calculates the force due to slippage on the substrate.

Since the model only alows for forces in `x` and `y` direction but not in `z` it is necessary to regularize the velocity at `` h \\rightarrow 0 ``.
The so called no-slip boundary condition can be in theory implemented using `δ` = 0. 
However as soon as the film dewets and `height` becomes small, the solution diverges.
Choosing `δ` = 1 satisfies the weak slip condition, while choosing it much larger than 1 yields the strong slip solution.

# Math
One and two dimensional approaches are essentially equal.
Behind the force is the idea of a parabolic shape of the velocity along `z`.
With the boundary conditions

`` \\mathbf{u}|_{h=H} = \\mathbf{u}  ``

`` \\mathbf{u}|_{h=0} = 0 ``

The parameter `δ` allows to push the zero velocity into the substrate, such below te computable region.
Solving this equation with some more assumptions yields

`` \\mathbf{F}_{slip} = \\mu\\alpha_{\\delta}(h) \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{6\\mu h \\mathbf{u}}{2 h^2 + 6\\delta h + 3\\delta^2}. ``

    computethermalcapillarywaves(mom, force, input)

Computes the forcing arising due to the inclusion of thermal capillary waves that undulate the free surface.

Adds a normal distributed term weighted with the thermal energy kbt to the forcing struct.
This addition makes it possible to simulate not only the thin film equation but also the stochastic thin film equation.

# Math
The stochastic thin film equation (STF) much like the thin film equation is derived from the Landau Lifshitz Navier Stokes equation (LLNS).
Assuming the fluctuations are small and not leading order one can perform an integration of the stochastic stresses, which was done by Grün et al.,

`` \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\cdot\\Big[\\frac{h^3}{3\\mu}\\nabla(\\Pi(h) - \\gamma \\Delta h) + \\int_0^h (h-y)\\mathcal{S}_{z||}(y)dy]. ``

Taking into account several assumption it can be shown that the above equation is equal to 

`` \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\cdot\\Big[\\frac{h^3}{3\\mu}\\nabla(\\Pi(h) - \\gamma \\Delta h) + \\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{3\\mu}h^3}\\mathcal{N}(t)]. ``

Such the integral of `` \\mathcal{S} `` can be expressed with a single multipicative noise term `` \\mathcal{N} `` which is gaussian distributed with zero mean and a variance of one.

This force is adding exactly the term with `` \\mathcal{N} `` to the forcing struct, however it is a little modified due to slippage.
